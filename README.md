# Express.js-Mobile-Storefront
A website for an imaginary phone shop. Server uses Express.js. 

Similar to the Python  version, but with some upgrades.

There are three pages available to customers, and one admin page. Customers can send orders. On the admin page, we can see these orders along with the customer's contact info. We can delete contacts and start/end a sale. The customers contact info and any sales are now stored in a database. Deleting the contact or the sale from the website now deletes it from the database. This project uses the mysql database.

The server is written in Express.js. There are APIs to handle GET, POST, and DELETE requests, all implemented in JavaScript.




## Not implemented in this version:

- Starting a sale doesn't give any discounts on the items.
